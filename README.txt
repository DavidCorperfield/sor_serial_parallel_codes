Source code of Parallel and Serial Red-Black SOR Implementation in Chapel, D and Go Languages


* Overview: The files in the folder present the source code of red-black SOR (successive over-relaxation) method in three state-of-the-art languages, viz. Chapel (from Cray Inc.), D (also called dlang, from Digital Mars) and Go (also called golang, from Google). Both serial and parallel versions of code are presented.
